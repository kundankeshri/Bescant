Interpolationv/s Property binding
=>Interpoaltion is a special syntax that Angular converts into a property binding.
=> Its a convenient alternative of property binding .
=> to concatenate strings we must use interpolation instead of property binding .
----------------------------------------
Property Binding :- 
=>Enclose the property name with the pair of square brackets .
=>Cannonical Veriation (bind.PropertyName)
=>Automatically synatizes the malecious content 

-----------------------------------------
DOM :-

<html>
 <head>
    <title>My Page Title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <script type='tect/javascript'></script>
   <div>
    <h1>This is browser DOM</h1>
   </div>
 </body>
</html>

windows->documant ->html 
                        -head -> title
                        -body -> script
                              ->div -> h1


=> DOM contains the HTML elements as objects ,their properties ,method and event and is a standard for asseccing , modifying,adding or deleting HTML elements .
=> Angular data binding is all about binding to DOM object not HTML element attribute.
=> Difference b/w HTML Element Attribute v/s DOM property:-
   (*) Attributes are defined by html where as properties are defined by DOM .
   (*) Attribute initalize the DOM properties. Once the initalization complete , the attribute job is done .
   (*) Property values can change, where as attribute values can't .
       -> inputId.getAttribute('value');
       -> inputId.value


Important Points :- 
=> HTML attribute and DOM property are different .
=>Angular binding works with property and events not with attributes.


-----------------------------------------------
Attribute Binding 

=> Angular binding works with property and events not with attributes bt sometime html doesn't have property and events then we have to use attribute binding .

------------------------------------------------
Class Binding 

=>Replace all the existing CSS classes with one or more classes
=>Add or remove single CSS classes
=>Add or remove multiple CSS classes

----------------------------------------------
Style Binding

=>to set multiple inline style use directive ngStyle 

-----------------------------------------------
Event Binding 
=>All above binding flows data from componet to html element
=>Event binding flows data from html element to Component
example :- Table hide and show tr 
-----------------------------------------------
TwoWay data binding 

=>$event object is exposed by angular data binding and contains event data
=>import import {FormsModule }   from '@angular/forms'; in app module to use [(ngModel)]
